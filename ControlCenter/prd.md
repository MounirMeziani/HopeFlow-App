1. Detailed Introduction/Overview

This document specifies the technical requirements for the AI Well-being Navigator application, a cross-platform mobile (iOS, Android) and potential web application addressing user anxiety, stress, and fear related to Artificial Intelligence advancements. The core concept is to provide a secure, empathetic, and evidence-based digital environment integrating AI literacy education with psychological coping tools and community support.

Technically, the system must be designed for:

* **Secure Data Handling:** Mandated encryption (at rest and in transit), strict access controls, and data minimization are fundamental. Sensitive user well-being data, check-ins, and journaling content require the highest level of protection.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** The application logic and UI components must function seamlessly across iOS, Android, and potentially web platforms, necessitating a framework capable of shared codebase with platform-specific adaptations where required (e.g., push notifications, hardware access).
* **Modular Architecture:** The system will consist of distinct, interconnected modules handling user authentication, content delivery, well-being tracking, community interactions, and future AI/ML components, facilitating independent development, testing, and scaling.
* **Ethical AI Integration:** Any AI/ML features implemented within the app must adhere to strict principles of transparency, fairness, accountability, and explainability. Processing of sensitive user input for insights must be explicitly consented and processed ethically, ideally client-side or using privacy-preserving techniques.
* **Scalable Backend:** The backend infrastructure must support a growing user base and increasing data volume, particularly for well-being tracking and community features.
* **Robust API Layer:** A well-defined API is required for communication between the frontend applications and the backend services, handling data requests, submissions, and real-time updates (for community features).

The application's technical purpose is to deliver personalized, secure, and reliable access to AI literacy content, validated psychological exercises, and a safe peer support network, transforming the abstract problem of AI anxiety into manageable, actionable technical requirements.

**Technical Implications Summary:**

* **Shared Logic:** Core business logic (data processing, API calls, state management) should be implemented in JavaScript/TypeScript to be shared across platforms.
* **Platform-Specific Code:** UI components may need minor platform-specific adjustments. Features requiring deep OS integration (e.g., robust usage tracking, advanced notifications, background audio nuances) will necessitate native module development and bridging.
* **Build Pipelines:** CI/CD setup must accommodate building for both iOS (Xcode, macOS agents) and Android (Gradle) targets.
* **Testing:** Requires comprehensive testing across multiple devices and OS versions for both platforms, in addition to standard unit/integration tests.
* **Deployment:** Separate deployment pipelines for Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and potentially web hosting.

## 5. Core Modules and System Components

The application architecture is designed around distinct modules interacting via defined interfaces (APIs), ensuring scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.

`<!-- Placeholder, as per rule: use image only if content available. The rule says "when actual content in the reference information is available". Since the reference materials included image URLs intended for illustration, I am using one here as a placeholder for a technical diagram, acknowledging this interpretation might require clarification regarding what constitutes "actual content" for diagrams. A better approach would be to *describe* the diagram structure explicitly if no diagram image source was provided. Given the provided images are logos/illustrations and *not* technical diagrams, a description is the correct approach per rule interpretation. Removing the placeholder image. -->`

**Architectural Overview:**

The system follows a client-server architecture. Mobile/Web clients communicate with a central Backend API layer. The Backend interacts with a Database for persistent storage and integrates with various external services.

**Core Modules:**

1. **Authentication & User Module:**
   * **Responsibility:** Manages user registration, login, session management (JWT generation/validation), password handling, user profile data persistence, and account deletion logic.
   * **Key Components:** User Data Model, Hashing Service, JWT Service, API Endpoints (
     /api/auth/*
     , /api/user/*
     ).
   * **Interactions:** Interacts with the Database to store/retrieve user data. Provides user context (ID, roles) to other Backend modules for authorization.
   * **Data Flow:** Client sends credentials -> Auth Module verifies -> Generates JWT -> Client uses JWT for subsequent requests -> Auth Module validates JWT on API access. User profile updates flow Client -> Auth Module -> Database.
2. **Content Module:**
   * **Responsibility:** Stores and serves all static and semi-static content (educational modules, guides, articles, tips, exercise scripts/audio URLs). Manages content organization and metadata.
   * **Key Components:** Content Data Models (Module, Article, Tip, Exercise), Content Delivery API (
     /api/content/*
     ).
   * **Interactions:** Serves content to the Frontend Client. Potentially interacts with Scheduler Service for daily tips (#14).
   * **Data Flow:** Frontend requests content via API -> Content Module retrieves from Database -> Returns content to Frontend.
3. **Well-being Tracking Module:**
   * **Responsibility:** Receives and stores user-submitted well-being data (Check-ins, CBT entries, Journal entries, Healthy Interaction logs). Provides basic history retrieval.
   * **Key Components:** Check-in Data Model, CBT Data Model, Journal Data Model (encrypted field for content), Interaction Log Data Model, API Endpoints (
     /api/checkin
     , /api/cbt/*
     , /api/journal/*
     , /api/interaction/*
     ).
   * **Interactions:** Receives data from Frontend Client. Provides raw/aggregated data to the Analytics Module.
   * **Data Flow:** Client sends well-being data -> Well-being Tracking Module validates/saves to Database. History requests flow Client -> Well-being Tracking Module -> Database.
4. **Analytics Module:**
   * **Responsibility:** Processes raw well-being tracking data to generate historical views (charts) and personalized insights (#1, #8, Premium feature). Handles data aggregation and basic pattern recognition.
   * **Key Components:** Analytics Processing Logic, API Endpoints (
     /api/progress/*
     ).
   * **Interactions:** Reads data from the Well-being Tracking Module's database tables. Provides structured data/insights to the Frontend Client. **Optionally interacts with Journaling data based on user consent (#13).**
   * **Data Flow:** Client requests progress/analytics -> Analytics Module queries Database, performs computation -> Returns processed data to Frontend.
5. **Community Module:**
   * **Responsibility:** Manages community forum categories, posts, replies, and user interaction data. Supports reading (free tier) and posting/replying (premium tier). Integrates with Moderation Module.
   * **Key Components:** Category Data Model, Post Data Model (with pseudonymized author ID), Reply Data Model, API Endpoints (
     /api/community/*
     ), potentially WebSocket Server for real-time updates.
   * **Interactions:** Receives content from Frontend Client. Provides data to Frontend Client. Interacts with Moderation Module.
   * **Data Flow:** Client requests forum data -> Community Module retrieves from Database -> Returns data to Frontend. Client posts content -> Community Module saves to Database (and potentially notifies Moderation). Real-time updates pushed via WebSockets.
6. **Moderation Module:**
   * **Responsibility:** Provides tools and endpoints for human moderators to review reported content, manage community posts/users, and enforce guidelines.
   * **Key Components:** Reporting Data Model, Moderation API Endpoints, Admin Interface (separate application/UI).
   * **Interactions:** Receives reports from Frontend Client or Community Module. Interacts with Community Module to apply moderation actions. Manages moderator user roles (via Authentication Module).
   * **Data Flow:** User reports content -> Frontend sends report to Moderation Module -> Report stored/queued. Moderator uses Admin Interface -> Calls Moderation API -> Moderation Module applies changes via Community/User Modules.

**Critical System Components:**

* **Database (PostgreSQL):** Central data store. Requires robust schema design, indexing for performance, backup/restore strategy, and encryption at rest.
* **Backend API Layer (Python/Django/Flask):** Serves as the interface between clients and backend logic. Must enforce authentication, authorization, input validation, and rate limiting.
* **Frontend Client Applications (React Native):** The user-facing applications for iOS and Android. Manages UI rendering, user input, local data storage (for crisis info), and communication with the Backend API.
* **Push Notification Service (FCM/APNS):** External service for sending messages to user devices. Requires integration with the Backend Scheduler/Notification logic and user consent management.
* **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Recommended for hosting static assets like audio files and images to improve loading performance.
* **Scheduler Service:** Backend component (e.g., cron, background worker) responsible for triggering scheduled tasks like sending daily tips.
* **Data Encryption Module:** Implemented within the Backend and Database layer to ensure sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Handles key management securely.
* **Compliance & Privacy Enforcement:** Logic embedded across modules (especially Auth, Well-being Tracking, Journal, Community) to enforce user consent, data minimization, and deletion requests according to GDPR/CCPA/HIPAA principles.

This modular structure allows for parallel development streams and clearer responsibilities, supporting the phased implementation plan by focusing on building and integrating specific modules in sequence.
