# Backend Technical Specification

This document details the technical specifications for the backend implementation of the AI Well-being Navigator application, translating product requirements into actionable technical tasks and system designs for AI coding agents.

## **1. Backend Principles and Architecture**

Based on the foundational requirements (PRD Section 1, 2, 5), the backend architecture adheres to the following principles:

* **Secure Data Handling:** Implement encryption at rest (e.g., AES-256 equivalent) and in transit (TLS 1.2+) for all sensitive user data, especially well-being logs and journal entries. Apply strict access controls and data minimization principles.
* **Modular Design:** Structure the backend into distinct, loosely coupled services/modules (Authentication, Content, Well-being Tracking, Analytics, Community, Moderation, etc.) interacting via well-defined internal interfaces or APIs. This supports independent development, testing, and scaling.
* **Robust API Layer:** Provide a stateless, RESTful API for client-server communication. The API must enforce authentication, authorization (based on user roles/premium status), input validation, and rate limiting.
* **Scalability:** Design components to handle increasing data volume and user concurrency. Utilize technologies and patterns suitable for scaling horizontally (e.g., stateless API servers, scalable database).
* **Data Integrity and Persistence:** Ensure data consistency and reliability through appropriate database design, transaction management, and robust backup strategies.
* **Asynchronous Processing:** Utilize background job processing for non-immediate tasks (e.g., sending notifications, generating complex analytics reports) to keep the main API responsive.
* **Compliance & Privacy-by-Design:** Embed logic to enforce user consent, handle data deletion requests (
  DELETE /api/user/profile
  with cascading delete), and ensure data processing aligns with ethical guidelines and regulations (e.g., GDPR/CCPA/HIPAA, PRD Section 1, 2, 13).

The system architecture is a standard client-server model, with frontend clients communicating exclusively via the Backend API Layer which interacts with the central Database and external services (PRD Section 5).

## **2. Backend Technology Stack**

Based on the PRD's recommendations and standard practices for scalable web services (PRD Section 4, 5):

* **Language:** Python
  * **Justification:** Strong libraries for web development, data processing, and potential future AI/ML integrations. Widely used for backend services.
* **Framework:** Django or Flask
  * **Justification:** **Django:** Provides an ORM, admin panel, authentication system, and robust framework for rapid development of complex applications with a database. **Flask:** More lightweight and flexible, suitable for building smaller microservices if a distributed architecture is preferred. **Decision between Django/Flask depends on final architecture scale review, but both support the requirements.** Assume Django ORM for data model descriptions unless Flask is chosen.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
  * **Justification:** Robust, open-source relational database. Excellent support for structured and semi-structured data (e.g., JSONB), transactions, indexing, and scalability. Suitable for handling sensitive data with features like row-level security and encryption at rest plugins.
* **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
  * **Justification:** Industry standard for stateless session management. Generated upon successful login, sent via Authorization header (
    Bearer `<token>`
    ), and validated on subsequent requests.
* **Background Jobs:** Celery with a Broker (e.g., Redis or RabbitMQ)
  * **Justification:** Distributed task queue for executing asynchronous and scheduled tasks (like daily notifications, PRD #14).
* **Push Notifications:** Server-side integration with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Android and Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) for iOS.
  * **Justification:** Standard services for reliable push notification delivery across platforms.
* **Content Storage:** Cloud Storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) accessible via CDN.
  * **Justification:** Scalable and performant storage for static assets like audio files and images, serving them via a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for faster client access (PRD Section 5).

## **3. API Endpoints and Specifications**

This section details the required RESTful API endpoints derived from the PRD's user stories and technical specifications (PRD Section 3). All endpoints should return JSON responses and handle standard HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).

All authenticated endpoints require a valid JWT in the

Authorization: Bearer `<token>`

 header.

## **4. Data Model Design**

Based on the requirements and API specifications, the core database tables and their key fields are outlined below. Relationships (e.g., foreign keys) and indexing for common query patterns (e.g., by user_id, timestamp, category_id) are critical for performance.

| Table Name           | Key Fields & Types                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Relationships               | Notes                                                                                  |

## **5. Core Backend Modules/Services**

Detailed responsibilities and internal logic flow for the key backend modules (PRD Section 5):

### **5.1 Authentication & User Module**

* **Responsibilities:** Handle user registration, password hashing (e.g., using
  bcrypt
  ), login (verify credentials, generate JWT), JWT validation middleware for API access, user profile management (GET
  /PUT
  ), password reset flow, and account deletion (DELETE /api/user/profile
  ).
* **Logic:**
  * **Signup:** Receive username, password, optional email/demographics. Hash password. Create
    User
    record. Generate JWT.
  * **Login:** Receive username, password. Retrieve
    User
    by username. Compare hashed password. If match, generate JWT.
  * **JWT Validation:** Middleware checks
    Authorization
    header, verifies JWT signature and expiry. If valid, attaches user ID/object to the request context.
  * **Profile Management:** Retrieve/update
    User
    record based on authenticated user ID from JWT context.
  * **Password Reset:** Generate secure one-time code, store temporarily (e.g., in cache with expiry), send email. Confirmation endpoint verifies code, updates password hash.
  * **Account Deletion:** Retrieve user ID from JWT. Perform cascading delete on
    users
    table, configured to remove related records in checkins
    , cbt_entries
    , journal_entries
    , interaction_logs
    , community_posts
    , community_replies
    , moderation_reports
    , user_settings
    . Requires careful transaction management to ensure atomicity.

### **5.2 Content Module**

* **Responsibilities:** Store and serve educational/exercise content (
  content_items
  table). Manage content metadata. Provide API endpoints to list (/api/content/modules
  ) and retrieve specific content (/api/content/{id}
  ). Handle serving audio files (potentially via CDN links).
* **Logic:**
  * Content is pre-loaded into the
    content_items
    table via administrative interface or script.
  * Endpoints query the
    content_items
    table based on type or ID.
  * GET /api/content/{id}
    returns the
    content_structure
    JSONB field directly to the client for rendering. media_url
    is returned for audio/images, pointing to CDN.

### **5.3 Well-being Tracking Module**

* **Responsibilities:** Receive and store user-submitted data from check-ins, CBT forms, and interaction logs (
  checkins
  , cbt_entries
  , interaction_logs
  tables). Provide basic history retrieval endpoints.
* **Logic:**
  * Receive POST requests for check-in, CBT, interaction data.
  * Validate input data structure and types.
  * Associate data with the authenticated
    user_id
    from JWT context.
  * Save records to the respective tables.
  * Handle GET requests for history, querying tables by
    user_id
    and optionally timestamp
    range or limit
    .

### **5.4 Analytics Module**

* **Responsibilities:** Process historical well-being data (
  checkins
  , interaction_logs
  ) to generate aggregated views, simple counts, and structured data for charts (/api/progress/summary
  , /api/progress/analytics
  ). Handle premium access check for advanced analytics. (Future: Process Journal data for insights if consent given).
* **Logic:**
  * **Summary:** Query
    checkins
    for recent entries (e.g., last 7/30 days), perform counts/basic aggregations. Query interaction_logs
    for total count or recent activity.
  * **Analytics (Premium):** Check
    is_premium
    flag on the authenticated user. If premium, perform more complex queries and aggregations (e.g., time series data for charts, frequency counts of triggers). Structure response data for frontend charting libraries.
  * **Journal Insights (Future/Opt-in):** Check
    is_premium
    and journal_insights_opt_in
    flags. If both true, retrieve **decrypted** journal entries for the user. Perform NLP processing (sentiment analysis, topic modeling). Generate summary insights. **Requires careful consideration of processing location (server vs. client), resource use, and ethical implications.**

### **5.5 Community Module**

* **Responsibilities:** Manage forum categories, posts, and replies (
  community_categories
  , community_posts
  , community_replies
  tables). Implement read access for all users and write access (POST /api/community/post
  , POST /api/community/post/{id}/reply
  ) limited to premium users. Handle pseudonymization of user identity in community posts/replies.
* **Logic:**
  * **Read Endpoints:** Query tables to retrieve category lists, post lists (filtered by category, paginated), and single post details with associated replies. Join with
    users
    table to get the author_pseudonym
    (or generate/store a fixed pseudonym per user for community).
  * **Write Endpoints:** Check
    is_premium
    flag on the authenticated user. If not premium, return 403 Forbidden. If premium, validate input, create new community_posts
    or community_replies
    records, associating them with the user_id
    and using the pre-generated/retrieved author_pseudonym
    .
  * **Pseudonymization:** A user's community identity should be a consistent pseudonym (e.g., "User12345") generated upon their first community interaction or account creation, stored in the
    users
    table, and used in community_posts
    and community_replies
    instead of their potentially sensitive username/email.

### **5.6 Moderation Module**

* **Responsibilities:** Receive and store content reports (
  moderation_reports
  table). Provide API endpoints for moderators to view reports and apply actions (hide, delete, edit content; warn, ban users). Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to moderator endpoints.
* **Logic:**
  * **Reporting:**
    POST /api/community/{id}/report
    creates a moderation_reports
    record linked to the reporter and content item.
  * **Moderator Access:** All
    /api/moderation/*
    endpoints require authentication **and** checking the is_moderator
    flag on the authenticated user. Return 403 Forbidden if flag is false.
  * **Report Review:**
    GET /api/moderation/reports
    queries the moderation_reports
    table, potentially joining with community_posts
    /community_replies
    to show reported content snippets.
  * **Applying Actions:**
    POST /api/moderation/content/{id}
    and POST /api/moderation/user/{id}
    endpoints receive action types. Implement logic to update the relevant community_posts
    /community_replies
    (e.g., set an is_hidden
    flag, soft delete, or hard delete based on policy) or users
    table (e.g., set is_banned
    flag). Actions should be logged for audit purposes.

## **6. Authentication and Authorization**

* **Authentication:** Handled by the Authentication Module using JWTs.
  1. User sends credentials to
     POST /api/auth/login
     or POST /api/auth/signup
     .
  2. Backend validates credentials.
  3. If valid, backend generates a JWT containing non-sensitive user claims (e.g., user ID,
     is_premium
     , is_moderator
     ) and signs it with a secret key. Token expiry is set (e.g., 24 hours, with refresh potential if needed, though not specified in PRD).
  4. JWT is returned to the client.
  5. Client includes the JWT in the
     Authorization: Bearer `<token>`
     header for all subsequent requests to authenticated endpoints.
  6. Backend API middleware intercepts requests, extracts the token, verifies the signature using the secret key, and checks expiry.
  7. If the token is valid, the request proceeds to the appropriate handler with the user's identity established. If invalid or missing, return 401 Unauthorized.
* **Authorization:** Handled by checking user attributes (
  is_premium
  , is_moderator
  ) derived from the authenticated user's JWT claims or database lookup on specific endpoint handlers.* Premium features (Community posting/replying, Advanced Analytics, Journal Insights) must check the
  is_premium
  flag. If false, return 403 Forbidden.
  * Moderation features must check the
    is_moderator
    flag. If false, return 403 Forbidden.
  * User-specific data access (Check-ins, CBT, Journal, Interaction logs) must ensure the requested data belongs to the authenticated
    user_id
    .

## **7. Data Handling and Security**

* **Encryption:**
  * **In Transit:** All communication between frontend clients and the backend API must use TLS 1.2 or higher.
  * **At Rest:** The database must be configured with encryption at rest for the entire data volume. Additionally, the content of the
    journal_entries.content
    field **must** be explicitly encrypted at the application level (e.g., using AES-256 with a robust key management strategy) before being stored in the database. This provides an extra layer of protection for this highly sensitive data point. Keys must be stored securely, separate from the database.
* **Password Hashing:** Store user passwords only as strong, one-way hashes generated using a cryptographically secure algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2 (PRD Section 3, #1 spec). Never store plain text passwords.
* **Data Minimization:** Collect only the minimum necessary user data. Make fields like email and demographics optional during signup (PRD Section 3, #1).
* **Data Deletion:** Implement the
  DELETE /api/user/profile
  endpoint to perform a full, cascading delete of all user-specific data (check-ins, journal entries, etc.) from the primary database. Define a policy for removing data from backups within a specified timeframe (PRD Section 3, #1 spec).
* **Consent Management:** The
  user_settings
  table includes journal_insights_opt_in
  (and potentially others in the future). Backend logic for the /api/journal/insights
  endpoint must check this flag **before** processing journal data. Provide API endpoint (PUT /api/user/settings/
  ) for users to manage these preferences.
* **Pseudonymization:** Ensure community content uses pseudonyms derived from user IDs, not actual usernames or emails (PRD Section 3, #9).

## **8. Background Processing**

* **Daily Tips:** A scheduled task (e.g., Celery Beat) will run daily.

  1. Retrieve a daily tip
     content_item
     from the database (e.g., based on a 'tip' type and potentially a rotation/scheduling logic).
  2. Query
     user_settings
     for users who have notifications_enabled
     set to true and have registered fcm_token
     or apns_token
     .
  3. For each user, construct a push notification payload (title, body based on the tip content).
  4. Send payloads to FCM and APNS APIs using user tokens.

  * **Task Queue:** Use Celery workers to handle sending notifications asynchronously to avoid blocking the scheduler or API process.
* **Future Tasks:** Could include periodic data aggregation for analytics, data retention policy enforcement, or sending other types of scheduled notifications.

## **9. Scalability and Performance Considerations**

* **Stateless API:** Ensure API endpoints do not maintain client-specific state server-side between requests (state is managed via JWTs or database). This allows scaling horizontally by adding more API server instances behind a load balancer.
* **Database Scaling:** PostgreSQL can be scaled vertically initially (more powerful server) and horizontally later (read replicas, sharding) as data volume and read/write loads increase. Indexing critical columns (
  user_id
  , timestamp
  , category_id
  , post_id
  ) is essential for query performance.
* **Caching:** Implement caching for frequently accessed but less volatile data (e.g., lists of content modules, community categories). Redis or Memcached can be used as caching layers.
* **Background Jobs:** Offloading non-critical, long-running tasks to a background queue (Celery) prevents API latency spikes.
* **CDN Usage:** Serve static assets (audio, images) from a CDN to reduce load on the backend servers and improve frontend loading times.
* **Efficient Queries:** Optimize database queries, especially for history and analytics endpoints that might process large amounts of data. Avoid N+1 query problems.
* **Resource Monitoring:** Implement monitoring for database connections, CPU/memory usage on servers, API response times, and error rates to identify bottlenecks.

## **10. Integration Points**

* **Push Notification Services:** Backend integrates with external FCM and APNS APIs to send notifications. Requires managing API keys and handling service responses (success/failure).
* **Cloud Storage/CDN:** Backend stores media files in cloud storage and provides CDN URLs to the frontend. Requires configuring storage buckets and CDN distribution.
* **Email Service:** Required for the password reset flow. Integration with an email provider API (SendGrid, SES, etc.).
* **Potential Future Integrations:** AI/ML services for Journal Insights (if processed server-side, potentially requiring specialized hardware or cloud ML platforms), external AI usage tracking APIs (if manual logging is supplemented), third-party analytics tools.
