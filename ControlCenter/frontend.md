# Frontend Implementation Plan

This document outlines the technical specifications for the frontend implementation of the AI Well-being Navigator application, targeting AI coding agents for development. It translates product requirements into actionable technical tasks, focusing on UI components, data flow, architecture, and platform considerations.

## **1. UI/UX Principles for AI Coding Implementation**

The frontend must be built with the following technical principles derived from core design philosophies (PRD Section 2, 3):

* **Predictable State Management:** Implement a robust state management pattern to handle complex user interactions, data synchronization with the backend API, and UI updates reliably. Ensure atomic state changes and clear data flow paths.
* **Efficient Rendering:** Optimize component rendering lifecycle to ensure smooth performance across target devices, minimizing re-renders and managing large lists or dynamic content efficiently.
* **Clear Component Interfaces:** Design reusable UI components with well-defined props (input data), state (internal component representation), and events (user interactions, lifecycle hooks). This facilitates modular development and testing.
* **API Interaction Handling:** Implement standard patterns for consuming RESTful APIs: asynchronous data fetching, handling loading states, managing errors (network issues, backend validation failures), and data transformation between API response and UI state.
* **Input Validation & Feedback:** Implement client-side input validation where appropriate (e.g., form inputs) and provide immediate, clear visual feedback to the user based on interaction or backend responses (e.g., success messages, validation errors).
* **Accessibility Integration:** Build accessibility features directly into component structure and rendering logic from the outset (PRD Section 2). This includes proper semantic markup, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation handling, and dynamic text size support.
* **Local Data Persistence:** Implement secure local storage mechanisms for critical, offline-accessible data (e.g., Crisis Resources, PRD #12) and potentially for queuing user input data (check-ins, journaling) for later synchronization when connectivity is available (PRD Section 2).

## **2. Frontend Technology Stack**

Based on the PRD's recommendation (Section 4) for cross-platform compatibility and development efficiency, the primary technology choices are:

* **Framework:** React Native (Latest stable version)
  * **Justification:** Enables shared codebase across iOS and Android (and potentially Web future), leveraging native UI components via the bridge for performance and platform look-and-feel. Supports modular architecture (PRD Section 1).
* **Language:** TypeScript (Latest stable version)
  * **Justification:** Provides static typing, improving code maintainability, detecting errors early in the development cycle, and providing better tooling support for large codebases. Essential for clear component interfaces and data structures.
* **State Management:** Redux Toolkit or Zustand
  * **Justification:** Manages application-wide state (e.g., authentication status, fetched content, user data). Required for synchronizing data across different screens and components in a predictable manner. Redux Toolkit provides opinionated best practices; Zustand is a lighter alternative suitable for React hooks. Selection depends on final architecture scale review.
* **Navigation:** React Navigation (Latest stable version)
  * **Justification:** Standard solution for handling screen transitions, stack navigation, tab navigation, and routing within React Native applications. Supports deep linking (PRD Section 3, #14 implication).
* **UI Component Library:** React Native Paper or NativeBase
  * **Justification:** Provides pre-built, customizable UI components adhering to Material Design guidelines (Android) and adapting reasonably to iOS Human Interface Guidelines, accelerating development and ensuring consistency (PRD Section 2).
* **Networking:** Axios or Fetch API
  * **Justification:** Standard libraries for making HTTP requests to the Backend API layer (PRD Section 1). Requires configuration for JWT inclusion, error handling, and potentially request/response interception.
* **Local Storage:**
  @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
  * **Justification:** Persistent key-value storage for small amounts of data locally (e.g., authentication tokens, critical offline content like crisis info).

## **4. Navigation & Routing Implementation**

(Based on PRD Section 3 implicit flow, Section 4 implications)

* **Library:** React Navigation (Stack, Tab, potentially Drawer navigators).
* **Structure:**
  * **Authentication Stack:** Handles
    Login
    , Signup
    , PasswordReset
    screens. Entry point for unauthenticated users.
  * **Main App Tabs:** Primary navigation for authenticated users. Tabs could include:
    * Home/Dashboard
      (Progress Summary, Check-in access)
    * Learn
      (Content Modules, Guides)
    * Tools
      (Meditations, CBT, Journal, Interaction Toolkit)
    * Community
      (Forum browser/interaction)
    * Settings
      (Profile, Notifications, Account Deletion)
  * **Modal/Stack Navigators (Nested):** For flows like:
    * Check-in process (could be a simple screen or short flow)
    * Opening a specific Content Module/Article from a list
    * Viewing a specific Community Post and its replies
    * Accessing Crisis Resources (must be immediately accessible from anywhere, possibly a root-level modal or dedicated persistent UI element).
* **Authentication Flow:**
  * Check for valid JWT on app start. If valid, navigate to Main App Tabs. If invalid or missing, navigate to Authentication Stack.
  * Successful login/signup navigates **replace** current stack with Main App Tabs.
* **Routing:**
  * Utilize screen components within navigators. Pass data via route params (e.g., content ID, post ID).
  * **Deep Linking:** Implement deep linking configuration (handled by React Navigation linking) to allow opening specific screens via URL schemes or universal links (relevant for tapping push notifications, PRD #14). Tapping a notification should trigger navigation to the corresponding content or community post.
* **State Management:** Navigation state is managed by React Navigation. Global application state (e.g., user authentication status, premium status) managed by Redux Toolkit/Zustand informs which navigation stacks/screens are accessible or how components within screens are rendered (e.g., enabling/disabling Community editor based on premium status).

## **5. Accessibility (A11y) Technical Requirements**

(Based on PRD Section 2 - Technical Implications)

Implementation must adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards equivalent for mobile applications.

* **Semantic Structure:** Utilize appropriate React Native components and ARIA-like props (
  accessibilityRole
  , accessibilityLabel
  , accessibilityHint
  ) to convey the purpose and state of UI elements to assistive technologies (e.g., buttons, links, headings, form fields).
* **Screen Reader Compatibility:**
  * Ensure all interactive elements and meaningful content are focusable and correctly announced by screen readers (VoiceOver, TalkBack).
  * Manage focus order logically within each screen.
  * Use
    accessibilityLiveRegion
    for dynamic content updates that screen reader users need to be aware of.
* **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements are navigable via keyboard (tab key equivalent) and can be activated using standard keyboard commands (Enter/Space). Manage focus state visibility.
* **Focus Management:** Programmatically manage focus for complex interactions (e.g., after opening a modal, submitting a form with errors) to guide screen reader and keyboard users.
* **Dynamic Type/Text Resizing:** Implement support for system-level text size settings. Utilize flexible UI layouts that accommodate larger text without content truncation or layout breakage. Use scale-independent pixels (
  sp
  ) for font sizes where appropriate, or libraries that handle dynamic scaling.
* **Color Contrast:** Adhere to minimum contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text and UI components) for text and interactive elements against their background. Implement design system tokens that meet contrast requirements or use development tools to check contrast.
* **Gesture Alternatives:** Ensure all actions triggered by complex gestures (e.g., swipes, long presses) can also be performed via simpler interactions (e.g., buttons, taps).
* **Captions/Transcripts:** If video content is introduced in the future, implement support for captions or provide transcripts for audio/video content (relevant for Guided Meditations if they were videos).
* **Testing:** Incorporate automated accessibility checks in the build process and manual testing with screen readers on target platforms.
